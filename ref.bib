Seat depth has been based on anthropometry or the so-called industry practice. The relevance of the widely used seat depth measure is thus questionable. A methodology has been developed to evaluate the useful seat depth for a target population. The methodology is found to be reliable and valid based on both objective and subjective measurements. A chair with an 'adjustable' seat depth was designed and developed for this purpose. A total of 30 Chinese students were tested. The objective measure was the seat edge protrusion when seated. Eight seat features were rated using a 5-point scale. The results show that the seat depth's of 30.4 and 38cm are significantly different, with the seat depth of 38cm being on the 'long side'. In addition, the objective measure of seat edge protrusion indicated that a seat depth of 31-33cm is adequate for the South China region Chinese population. Based on the subjective ratings and the objective measure developed, it may be concluded that a seat depth of 31-33cm is appropriate for the same population. Relevance to industry - Anthropometry alone is not sufficient for the design of seats. The differing sensitivity in the buttock and thigh areas is an indication that chairs should be designed and selected depending on the population under consideration. The need for having chairs of variable depth has to be recognized especially during long periods of sitting. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Forward sloping chairs have the disadvantage that the body tends to slide forwards off the seat and the possibilities for position change are limited in that leaning backwards is awkward. Theoretically a chair should support a variety of body positions thus allowing the relaxation of alternate groups of muscles (encouraging dynamic seating behaviour). The modified design retains the traditional slightly concave surface for the area under the ischial tuberosities but the front 18 cm is angled downward. Results were obtained using a measuring technique which incorporates the dynamic movement patterns of working people. They indicate that the modified form can be used to achieve similar postural changes to the traditional form when sloped forwards for both assembly work and VDU work. Additionally a wider range of seating positions is adopted on it. Although forward thrust was not reduced the design was rated as more comfortable. This raised questions about whether discomfort is directly related to forward thrust. The issue of table height was also raised.",

The results obtained from the experiments are compared with those obtained by other researchers. A set of simplified approximations to the various equivalent comfort contours are defined and a general approach to the prediction of discomfort due to multi-axis, multi-input complex vibration is given. It is shown that the results for translational vibration of a seat surface supporting the body are reasonably consistent with some previous studies. Although the contours for fore-and-aft and lateral vibration are in agreement with those in ISO 2631 (1978) there is evidence that sensitivity to vertical seat vibration above 8 Hz should be greater than defined in that standard. It is shown that the results for rotational seat vibration differ by an order of magnitude from those published by other authors but that this difference may be explained by the positions of the centres of rotation used in other studies. It is shown that simple approximations to the median equivalent comfort contours for translational and rotational seat vibration and translational foot and back vibration may be defined by contours on acceleration frequency graph having a slope of O dB per octave (constant acceleration) and 6 dB per octave (constant velocity). For most conditions these contours fall within the 25th-75th percentile of the experimental data. The application of these contours as frequency weightings for general vibration evaluations is discussed.",

In today's automotive engineering practice, however, design and development of new, more comfortable car seats is based almost entirely on empiricism, legacy knowledge and extensive, time-consuming and costly prototyping and experimental/field testing. To help accelerate and economize the design/development process of more-comfortable car seats, more extensive use of various computer aided engineering (CAE) tools will be necessary. However, before the CAE tools can be used more successfully by car-seat manufacturers, issues associated with the availability of realistic computer models for the seated human, the seat and the seated-human/seat interactions as well as with the establishment of objective seating-comfort quantifying parameters must be resolved. In the present work, detailed finite element models of a prototypical car seat and of a seated human are developed and used in the investigation of seated-human/seat interactions and the resulting seating comfort. To obtain a fairly realistic model for the human, a moderately detailed skeletal model containing 16 bone assemblies and 15 joints has been combined with an equally detailed \"skin\" model of the human. The intersection between the two models was then used to define the muscular portion of the human. Special attention in the present work has been given to realistically representing/modeling the materials present in different sections of the car seat and the seated human. The models developed in the present work are validated by comparing the computational results related to the pressure distribution over the seated-human/seat interface with their open-literature counterparts obtained in experimental studies involving human subjects. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

    abstract = "This study considers the effects of seated posture and body orientation on the pressure-distribution and surface shear (tangential) forces acting at the body-seat interface. Nine postures typically assumed by wheel-chair users were studied. Comparisons were made within and between two study groups, made up of 12 subjects with spinal cord injuries (SCI) and 10 nondisabled subjects. Both interface pressure and the surface shear were measured simultaneously in each of nine reproducible, seated postures. The same seat cushion was used for all trials. The Oxford Pressure Monitor, a pneumatic cell device, was used to measure and record the interface pressures. Instrumentation for measuring and recording the surface shear force was constructed specifically for the study. Analysis consisted of statistically comparing changes in pressure values and shear forces derived from eight sitting postures with reference to values recorded in a defined neutral sitting posture. The pressure-distribution findings suggest that in the postures studied SCI subjects have maximum pressures that are higher than nondisabled subjects in all postures, ranging from 6{\%} to 46{\%} depending on the posture. Maximum pressures can be reduced by postural changes: forward flexion to 50 degrees, -9{\%}; backrest recline to 120 degrees, -12{\%}; and, full body tilt, -11{\%}. On average, the SCI group members have peak pressure gradients (PPG) that are 1.5 to 2.5 greater than the nondisabled group. The maximum reduction in PPG occurred at backrest recline of 120 degrees, -18{\%}. Tangential shear force acts at the body-seat interface in all nine postures studied. Extrapolation of results suggests that full-body tilt to approximately 25 degrees reduces the surface shear force to near zero. In contrast, a backrest-only recline of 20 degrees causes a 25{\%} increase in the surface shear force. These results suggest that caution must be taken when using nondisabled subjects as surrogates for people with SCI because of the inherent differences between the groups. Also, researchers and clinicians should recognize that posture and body orientation in space are additional variables that can have a profound effect on the interaction between a seated person and his or her supporting surface.",

The higher density foams are used as standard biomechanical test materials, but none of the low density PU foams are universally accepted as models for osteoporotic (OP) bone. The aim of this study was to determine whether low density PU foam might be suitable for mimicking human OP cancellous bone.METHODS: Quasi-static compression tests were performed on PU foam cylinders of different lengths (3.9 and 7.7 mm) and of different densities (0.09, 0.16 and 0.32 g cm(-3)), to determine the Young's modulus, yield strength and energy absorbed to yield.RESULTS: Young's modulus values were 0.08-0.93 MPa for the 0.09 g cm(-3) foam and from 15.1-151.4 MPa for the 0.16 and 0.32 g cm(-3) foam. Yield strength values were 0.01-0.07 MPa for the 0.09 g cm(-3) foam and from 0.9-4.5 MPa for the 0.16 and 0.32 g cm(-3) foam. The energy absorbed to yield was found to be negligible for all foam cylinders.CONCLUSION: Based on these results, it is concluded that 0.16 g cm(-3) PU foam may prove to be suitable as an OP cancellous bone model when fracture stress, but not energy dissipation, is of concern.",

Twenty able-bodied subjects were seated on a pressure-sensing transducer incorporated into an adjustable chair (ischiobarograph). A video camera on the underside of the transducer detected changes in light levels in direct relation to pressure application. The camera output was processed by a microcomputer system that converted the signal into nine colors, each representing a distinct pressure interval in the range of 0 to more than 500 mm Hg. The microcomputer determined the area of each pressure interval before and after a 10-degree posterior tilt of the seat and lumbar support placement. The results demonstrated high test-retest reliability for each position (r = .95). A significant decrease in the six highest pressure intervals occurred when the lumbar support was used in both the upright and reclined positions (p less than .05). The results of this study have implications for wheelchair-dependent individuals.",

Finite element analysis can show the stress levels throughout the soft tissue between the cushion and the ischial tuberosity and give designers a better indication of the effects of a particular cushion. Finite element models were generated of the tissues around the ischial tuberosities of male and female subjects. Linear three-dimensional models were generated using a 386 computer and solved with infinitesimal deflection theory. The resulting minimal principal stresses were 17 kPa and 15 kPa at the buttock-cushion interface for seated male and female subjects, respectively. Computational results were verified experimentally with magnetic resonance imaging and interface pressure measurements.",

However, the development of new car seats is very time consuming and costly since it is typically based on experimental evaluation using prototypes. Computer models of the human-seat interaction could accelerate this process. The objective of this paper is to establish a protocol for the development of seat models using numerically efficient simulation techniques. The methodology is based on multi-body techniques: arbitrary surfaces, providing an accurate surface description, are attached to rigid bodies. The bodies are connected by kinematic joints, representing the seat back recliner and head restraint joint. Properties of the seat foam and frame have been lumped together. Further, experiments have been defined to characterise the mechanical properties required for the seat model for comfort applications. The protocol has been exemplified using a standard car seat. The seat model has been validated based on experiments with rigid loading devices with human-like shapes in terms of force-deflection characteristics. The response of the seat model agrees well with the experimental results. Therefore the presented method can be a useful tool in the seat development process, especially in early stages of the design process.",
